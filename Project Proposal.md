Finalize one Capstone idea based on the feedback you got from mentor(s) and peers on your Section 1 submission,
and also based on your newly acquired understanding of the tools and data wrangling. 
Submit a project proposal - a short (1-2 page) document that answers the following questions:

Q. What is the problem you want to solve?
A. Given an image and title (could be other data-points of an item), predict the category of the item user is searching for


Q. Who is your client and why do they care about this problem? In other words, what will your client DO or DECIDE based on your analysis that
they wouldn’t have otherwise?
A. Most ecommerce search engines have been text based, which has worked well uptil now. Images have started playing a huge role in showing the user 
exactly they are looking for. Idea here is to combine the text and image buyer or seller provides to predict a correct category for the item. 
Miscategorization is a big challenge marketplaces face today. Effort is towards improving that.


Q. What data are you going to use for this? How will you acquire this data?
A. Will use eBay Public APIs to fetch eBay items in the Shoes category.


Q. In brief, outline your approach to solving this problem (knowing that this might change later).

Q. What are your deliverables? Typically, this would include code, along with a paper and/or a slide deck.
A. Code plus slide deck
